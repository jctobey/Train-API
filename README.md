# Train-API
I built this train API application with the intent of incorporating information from this train API into the train scheduling homework using moment.js, but the moment.js overpowered me when I tried to convert time zone for this British API (time zone conversion) and then convert arrival time and minutes to arrival :(

Anyways, it's a functional app that shows train arrivals for Waterloo station, which is the largest train station in the UK! Marvel at all the strange british names for destinations and stuff.
